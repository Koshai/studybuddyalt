## 🎯 **CURRENT STATUS SUMMARY**

### **What Works Well:**
- ✅ Complete study workflow (upload → edit → generate → practice)
- ✅ User authentication and data isolation
- ✅ AI-powered question generation
- ✅ Rich text note editing with real-time updates
- ✅ Usage tracking and limits
- ✅ Local state management for responsive UI

### **Major Pain Points:**

2. **No payment system** - Can't monetize or lift usage limits
3. **Limited search** - Hard to find content in large collections
4. **Only MCQ questions** - Missing other question types
5. **No flashcards** - Missing popular study method

### **Technical Debt:**
- ~~Component-level state management~~ ✅ **RESOLVED** - Local state management working
- Mixed CDN/local dependencies (Quill.js now local, others still CDN)
- Limited error handling in some areas
- No automated testing framework

### **Business Blockers:**
