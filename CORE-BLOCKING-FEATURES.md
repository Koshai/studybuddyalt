# StudyBuddy - Core Blocking Features Analysis

## üö® CRITICAL CORE FEATURES MISSING - Preventing Platform Completion

These are the **essential features** that are currently blocking StudyBuddy from being what it's meant to be: a complete, monetizable study platform.

## üî¥ **#1 STRIPE PAYMENT SYSTEM** ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL BUSINESS BLOCKER

### Current Status: 
- ‚úÖ Stripe dependency installed (`"stripe": "^14.25.0"`)
- ‚ùå **ZERO implementation** - no payment processing code exists
- ‚ùå No subscription management backend
- ‚ùå No billing endpoints
- ‚ùå No payment UI components

### What's Missing:
```javascript
// COMPLETELY MISSING - needs to be built:
- Stripe webhook endpoints
- Payment intent creation
- Subscription management (create/update/cancel)
- Invoice handling
- Payment method management
- Failed payment handling
- Usage-based billing integration
- Plan upgrade/downgrade logic
- Payment history tracking
- Tax calculation (if needed)
```

### Business Impact:
**üö® This is a SHOW-STOPPER** - Without payments, there's no business model to support:
- Pro tier subscriptions ($19.99/month mentioned in UI)
- Usage limit enforcement
- Revenue generation
- Sustainable platform growth

## üî¥ **#2 NOTE EDITING SYSTEM** ‚ö†Ô∏è CORE FUNCTIONALITY BLOCKER

### Current Status:
- ‚úÖ File upload and OCR extraction works
- ‚ùå **Users cannot edit extracted notes**
- ‚ùå No rich text editor
- ‚ùå No manual note creation
- ‚ùå No note modification capability

### What's Missing:
```javascript
// Core study workflow is broken:
1. Upload file ‚Üí Extract text ‚úÖ
2. Edit/improve extracted content ‚ùå MISSING
3. Organize notes ‚ùå MISSING  
4. Generate questions ‚úÖ
5. Practice ‚úÖ
```

### User Impact:
**This breaks the fundamental study workflow** - users get messy extracted text but can't clean it up or add their own notes.

## üî¥ **#3 CONTENT ORGANIZATION** ‚ö†Ô∏è USABILITY BLOCKER

### Current Status:
- ‚úÖ Basic topic creation works
- ‚ùå **No search functionality**

- Tagging system
- Folder hierarchy  
- Filtering and sorting
- Content discovery
```

### User Impact:
**Platform becomes unusable with >20 notes** - users can't find their own content.

### What's Missing:
```javascript
// Limited learning effectiveness:
- Flashcard system with spaced repetition
- True/false questions
- Fill-in-the-blank questions  
- Matching exercises
- Short answer questions
```
