  - [ ] Implement global store for notes, topics, questions, users
  - [ ] Add event-driven state updates
  - [ ] Replace component-level API calls with store subscriptions
  - [ ] Ensure real-time UI updates across all views

### **2. Stripe Payment Integration** 💳 **BUSINESS BLOCKER**
- **Problem**: No way to monetize or upgrade users to Pro
- **Status**: ❌ **Not Started** 
- **Impact**: Zero revenue potential, users hit limits with no upgrade path
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Set up Stripe webhook endpoints
  - [ ] Implement payment intent creation
  - [ ] Add subscription management (create/cancel/upgrade)
  - [ ] Build billing UI components
  - [ ] Add invoice handling and payment history
  - [ ] Integrate with usage limit system

- ✅ Rich text editor integration (Quill.js)
- ✅ Note editing functionality
- ✅ Manual note creation
- ✅ Offline editor support (local Quill.js files)
- ✅ Backend API endpoints for CRUD operations
- ✅ Content persistence and validation

### **Previous Phases** *(Completed)*
- ✅ User authentication system (JWT)

## 🎯 **CURRENT STATUS SUMMARY**

### **What Works Well:**
- Core study workflow (upload → edit → generate → practice)
- User authentication and data isolation
- AI-powered question generation
- Rich text note editing
- Usage tracking and limits

### **Major Pain Points:**
1. **No real-time updates** - Manual refresh required
2. **No payment system** - Can't monetize or lift usage limits
3. **Limited search** - Hard to find content in large collections
4. **Only MCQ questions** - Missing other question types
5. **No flashcards** - Missing popular study method

### **Technical Debt:**
- Component-level state management (needs centralized store)
- Mixed CDN/local dependencies (needs consistency)
- Limited error handling in some areas
- No automated testing framework

### **Business Blockers:**
- No revenue stream (missing Stripe)
- Usage limits with no upgrade path
- Missing competitive features (flashcards, advanced search)

## 📝 **SESSION RECOVERY NOTES**

### **If Session Disconnects:**
1. Check this file for current project status
2. Check `CORE-BLOCKING-FEATURES.md` for priority analysis
3. Check `TODO-FEATURES.md` for detailed feature breakdown
4. Check git status for current changes
5. Review recent console logs for any errors

### **Key Files to Review:**
- `/src/frontend/components/Modals/NoteEditorModal.js` - Rich text editing
- `/src/frontend/components/Views/NotesView.js` - Notes management
- `/src/server/index.js` - API endpoints
- `/src/server/services/usage-service.js` - Usage tracking
- `/src/frontend/js/store-simplified.js` - Current state management

### **Recent Implementation Details:**
- Quill.js now loads from local files (`/lib/quill/`)
- Note editing saves to database correctly
- UI updates require manual refresh (state management issue)
- All Phase 1D features functionally complete
