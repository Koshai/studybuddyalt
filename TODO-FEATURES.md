## Implementation Notes

### Core Philosophy:
StudyBuddy should evolve from a "file-to-questions" tool into a comprehensive study platform that supports the complete learning workflow: content creation ‚Üí organization ‚Üí practice ‚Üí tracking ‚Üí improvement.

### Technical Considerations:
- Maintain hybrid storage architecture (SQLite + Supabase)
- Preserve AI service selection (Ollama preferred, OpenAI fallback)
- Keep usage tracking and subscription tier system
- Ensure mobile-responsive design throughout
