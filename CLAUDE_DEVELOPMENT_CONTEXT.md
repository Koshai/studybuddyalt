# Claude Development Context & Session Recovery

*Created: 2025-01-23*
*Purpose: Maintain development context across sessions*

## 🎯 Current Project Status

### **Project Name**: Jaquizy (StudyBuddy)
**Description**: AI-powered study platform for teachers and students
**Architecture**: Web-first + Desktop download, Vue.js + Node.js + Express
**AI Services**: OpenAI (primary) + Ollama (fallback)
**Storage**: Supabase (web) + SQLite (desktop)

### **Developer Profile**
- Solo developer (overwhelmed with testing)
- Teacher perspective - focus on facilitating student learning
- Prefers smaller, incremental implementations over big features

## 🔍 Last Analysis Summary

### **Current State** ✅
- User authentication & subscription tiers working
- File upload with OCR (Tesseract.js) 
- AI question generation (OpenAI + Ollama)
- Rich text note editing (Quill.js)
- Basic practice sessions with MCQ questions
- Cross-platform support (Web, Desktop, Mobile)

### **Critical Issues Found** 🚨
1. **Security**: Hardcoded admin emails in auth-middleware.js
2. **Business**: No Stripe payment integration (no monetization)
3. **Performance**: Missing database indexes, N+1 queries
4. **Code Quality**: Duplicated services, inconsistent error handling
5. **User Experience**: Gameshow mode identical to quiz mode

## 🎯 Agreed Implementation Priority

### **Phase 1: Quick Wins** (Start Here)
1. **Flashcards System** - Core study methodology missing
2. **Fix Gameshow Mode** - Make it distinct from quiz mode
3. **Testing Framework** - Essential for solo developer
4. **Security Hardening** - Remove hardcoded admin emails

### **Phase 2: Foundation**
1. Stripe payment integration
2. Content search and tagging
3. Additional question types (T/F, fill-in-blank)
4. Error handling standardization

### **Phase 3: Teaching Tools**
1. Study scheduling and reminders
2. Student progress analytics
3. Class/group management
4. Advanced question types

## 🏫 Teacher-First Design Philosophy

### **Core Principles**
- **Facilitate Learning**: Every feature should help students learn better
- **Reduce Teacher Workload**: Automate repetitive tasks
- **Multiple Learning Styles**: Visual, auditory, kinesthetic support
- **Progress Tracking**: Clear visibility into student understanding
- **Engagement**: Gamification without losing educational value

### **Teacher Use Cases**
1. **Content Creation**: Easy note/question creation from materials
2. **Assessment**: Multiple question types for comprehensive testing
3. **Progress Monitoring**: Track individual and class performance
4. **Differentiation**: Adaptive difficulty for different skill levels
5. **Engagement**: Interactive modes that maintain learning focus

## 🔧 Technical Context

### **Key Files to Remember**
- `/src/frontend/js/main-simplified.js` - Main Vue app
- `/src/server/app.js` - Express server setup
- `/src/server/middleware/auth-middleware.js` - **SECURITY ISSUE HERE**
- `/src/frontend/components/Practice/` - Practice components
- `/archive/Reference/PROJECT_BACKLOG.md` - Previous analysis

### **Database Structure**
- **Users**: Authentication, subscription tiers
- **Subjects**: Fixed subject categories
- **Topics**: User-created study topics
- **Notes**: Rich text content with OCR extraction
- **Questions**: AI-generated practice questions
- **Practice_Sessions**: User practice history

### **Architecture Patterns**
- Service Factory pattern for environment-based service selection
- Hybrid storage (cloud/local) based on deployment mode
- Component-based Vue.js frontend
- JWT-based authentication

## 🧪 Testing Strategy Needed

### **Solo Developer Testing Approach**
1. **Unit Tests**: Core business logic (services, utilities)
2. **Integration Tests**: API endpoints with mock data
3. **E2E Tests**: Critical user flows (auth, practice session)
4. **Visual Regression Tests**: UI components don't break

### **Recommended Testing Stack**
- **Jest** - Unit testing framework
- **Supertest** - API endpoint testing  
- **Playwright** - E2E browser testing
- **Mock Service Worker** - API mocking

## 🎮 Gameshow Mode Enhancement Ideas

### **Current Problem**: Identical to quiz mode
### **Teacher-Friendly Solutions**:
1. **Team Competition**: Split class into teams
2. **Elimination Style**: Wrong answers eliminate players
3. **Speed Rounds**: Time pressure with leaderboards
4. **Daily Double**: Risk/reward question betting
5. **Visual Categories**: Jeopardy-style board layout

## 📚 Flashcard System Design

### **Teacher Requirements**
1. **Auto-Generation**: Create flashcards from notes/questions
2. **Manual Creation**: Custom flashcard creation
3. **Spaced Repetition**: Algorithm-based review scheduling
4. **Progress Tracking**: Individual student progress
5. **Class Sets**: Shared flashcard sets for entire class

### **Student Benefits**
1. **Personalized Review**: Adaptive scheduling based on performance
2. **Multiple Study Modes**: Recognition, recall, matching
3. **Progress Visualization**: Clear understanding of mastery
4. **Offline Support**: Study anywhere without internet

## 🔄 Session Recovery Protocol

### **If Session Disconnects**:
1. Read this file for current context
2. Check git status for recent changes
3. Review `/archive/Reference/PROJECT_BACKLOG.md`
4. Check browser console for any runtime errors
5. Verify current branch: `feature/simplified-architecture`

### **Quick Status Check Commands**:
```bash
git status
npm run dev
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
```

### **Current Working Directory**:
`C:\Users\boltu\Documents\StudyBuddy\studybuddyalt`

## 📝 Development Notes

### **Last Session Achievements**:
- Completed project analysis
- Identified security vulnerabilities
- Prioritized flashcard system implementation
- Established teacher-first design philosophy

### **Next Session Goals**:
1. Start flashcard system implementation
2. Fix gameshow mode to be distinct
3. Set up basic testing framework
4. Address security hardcoding issue

## 🎯 Success Metrics
